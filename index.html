            <p>I'm Carlos Palacios, actively performing Integration Engineering duties for the BACN program, previously a flight director for Unmanned aerospace platforms. In addition to meeting my daily challenges within the BACN program, I spend my available time immersing myself on new ideas to improve my skills in hopes of improving my immediate team . </p>
            <p>I’d like to thank you for taking the time reviewing my efforts in capturing my Integration engineering performance for the past six months. As I've previously experienced, judging your own staffs’ performance can be a stressful time. My attempt is to project my enthusiasm that I have for this team and to say thank you for hiring me this spring. Feel free to select the icons as they will take you to my professional site to learn more about my skills and how I might be able to contribute further to the BACN program. To make this review more convenient for you I've also made this page mobile friendly. It will display in either your mobile devices or desktops. If viewed in mobile device the background will change color in hopes to make it easier to read the text.
            </p>
            <p>My performance overall shows that I am able to organize my own work and complete it independently. I’ve provided timely corrections on technical issues, delivered high quality results on time within minimum supervision. I’ve adhered to safe practices when performing assigned tasks. I’ve contributed technical knowledge to problem solving and decision-making process with the new hire training package / Integration reference guide and the BOE Proposal tool. I’ve used good judgement in the face of uncertainty when dealing with the NAS and AEP along with integrating new ground servers resulting in my drive to deliver uncompromising quality in all products and services. These past 6 months I’ve acquired in depth knowledge in technical areas of specialization within the BACN Integration team. I’m striving to model personal career growth and continuous development in pursuing learning and self-development while constantly demonstrating my own initiative. </p>
            <p>Once again Thank you for your time</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p> Carlos Palacios</p>
