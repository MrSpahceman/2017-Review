            <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
            <p>I'm Carlos Palacios, actively performing Integration Engineering duties for the BACN program, previously a flight director for Unmanned aerospace platforms. In addition to meeting the agressive schedules within BACN I spend my available time taking on new challenges to improve my skills. Feel free to select the connect with me icons of the right of this page. They will take you to a couple of my professional sites where .</p>
            <p>Id like to take this time to formally thank you for taking the time to review my efforts in capturing my performance for the past six months. As I've previously experianced in the past, judging your own staff's performance can be a stressful time. My apptempt is simply to try and pass on my enthusiasm that I have thanks to being hired on this spring. I hope this brakes the monotomy of the endless amount of text from reviewing the other team members performance. Feel free to select the icons as they will take you to my professional site to learn more about my skills and how I might be able to contribute further to the BACN program. To make this review more conveniant for you I've also made this page mobile friendly. It will display in either your mobile divices or laptops. If viewed in mobile device the background will change color in hopes to make it easier to read the text.
            </p>
            <p>Once again Thank you for your time</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p> Carlos Palacios</p>
